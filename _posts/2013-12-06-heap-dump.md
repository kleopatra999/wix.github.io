# Heap Dump (jmap)

* To take a heap dump you must be using the same user that the process is running under
* Get process user and id by running: `ps -A -f | grep <name-of-artifact>`

Get dump:

```
$ sudo -u <user-running-process> jmap -dump:file=/tmp/my-dump.hdump 27828
```

Don't save the dump to your home dir, because it will be replicated on all servers. Analyze dump in `jvisualvm` or Eclipse with [memory analyzer](http://www.eclipse.org/mat/) plugin.
