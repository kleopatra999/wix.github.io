##About Wix & Wix App Market
Since 2008 more than 28 million websites have been built using Wix's state of the art, drag-and-drop web building editor. Renowned for its creative, no-coding-needed flexibility, small businesses and individuals have flocked to the Wix platform.

More than 4 million people engage with the Wix editor each month, publishing more than 1 million new websites during that same time frame.
With this as a foundation, a massive new web developer opportunity presented itself in October of 2012 as the Wix App Market launched and was integrated within the Wix editor. How big an opportunity? At present there are more than 500,000 App installations through the Wix App Market every month.

Currently, with less than 70 Apps in the App Market, the average App is getting more than 7,000 installations per month.
