        <h3>Preface</h3>

<p>TODO some introduction to Scala @ Wix should come here</p>

        <h3>Learning Scala</h3>
<p>Probably the best introductory text to Scala available today is Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/">Scala School</a>. Read it thoroughly but not in a single run. Return to it from time to time
to refreshen your knowledge and for concrete reference in case of need.</p>
<p>Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala">Effective Scala</a> document provides best practice guidelines that we agree with in most cases. Read below for specific cases where we may disagree
with it or we have something to add. <strong>This is a mandatory read</strong> before you start coding in Scala.</p>

        <h3>Do's and Don'ts</h3>
    <h4>XML</h4>
    <p>Don't use the <em>scala.xml</em> package; first of all, do you really neex XML support? if all you need is serialization, consider using JSON. If you <strong>really</strong> need XML, use JAXB.</p>
    <h4>JSON</h4>
    <p>Use Jackson with the <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala">Scala Module</a>. It should allow you to fully serialize and deserialize Case Classes, Monads, Scala collections, etc.</p>
    <h4>Collections<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Always prefer immutable collections; if you think you need a mutable collection, ask yourself why, then consult a colleague</li>
        <li>For ordered sequences (where you would've used <em>java.util.List</em>, use Seq)</li>
        <li>For ConcurrentMaps, see the appropriate page at Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/concurrency.html#solutions">Concurrency</a> lesson and the
        <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/concrete-mutable-collection-classes.html#concurrent_maps">Scala API Docs</a></li>
        <li>Read the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/#Collections">Collections</a> section of Effective Scala for more info</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>
    <p>Adhere to the regular principles; separation of concerns and the single responsibility principle are easy to achieve using traits
    and mixins. Use case classes for value types (operation input / output values), even if the input is a single argument. This makes your 
    code more structured and resilient to future changes.</p>
    <h4>Enums</h4>
    <p>Don't extend Scala's Enumeration type. Instead, created a sealed trait as your enum type and extend it with case objects:
        <pre>
            sealed trait Animal
            case object Cat extends Animal
            case object Dog extends Animal
            case object Goat extends Animal
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h4>Dependency Injection</h4>
    <p>Use plain constructor injection; avoid cake pattern as it makes unit testing difficult. Prefer composition over inheritance.
    Use cake pattern in wiring code (Spring configuration classes); each configuration class should declare its dependencies as abstract
    methods.</p>
    <h4>Learning</h4>
    <p>The Scala REPL is a powerful tool. Learn how to use it.</p>
